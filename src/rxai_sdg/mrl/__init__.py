    ## TASK DESCRIPTION
    Generate {num_examples} examples of interconnected interactions testing multi-step memory retention. They will be
    used to train reactive models, that works in real-time processing mode - processing only the single messages (interactions),
    and keeps conversation history in short-term memory.

    Each example must:

    1. Start with initial factual QA (geography/science/history) - query and answer
    2. Contain {steps} follow-up QAs progressively referencing prior answers - list of queries and answers
    3. Each answer introduces 3-4 new facts while repeating 3+ previous facts
    4. Final interaction requires synthesizing info from {prior_steps}+ prior steps
    ## FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

    # Memory Reinforcement Learning Data Generation - {steps} Step(s) - Long-Range Strategy

    ## TASK DESCRIPTION
    Generate {num_examples} examples of interconnected interactions testing long-range and multi-step memory retention. They
    will be used to train reactive models, that works in real-time processing mode - processing only the single messages (interactions),
    and keeps conversation history in short-term memory.
    
    In Long-Range strategy each generated example should contain two completely different message **topics**:
    - first topic is used only in first and last interaction
    - second topic is used in all interactions between first and last

    Each example must:

    1. Start with initial factual QA (geography/science/history/others) - query and answer - for the first **topic**
    2. Contain {steps} follow-up QAs list of queries and answers
    3. First query in follow-up QAs (interactions) is changing **topic** into second one - not connected to first QA, and answer is also for new **topic**
    4. All next follow-up interactions, except the last one, have to continue the second **topic**:
        - Each answer introduces 3-4 new facts while repeating 3+ previous facts

        ## CRITICAL RULES
        1. Factual Consistency:
          - All geographical/scientific facts must be accurate
          - No fictional elements - only real-world entities
          - Real-world knowledge, but only a basic facts like in examples
          - Simple facts in form of stories
          - Shouldn't include a lot of numbers - only basic facts
          - No calculations, etc., only the knowledge and just dialog content
        2. Non-formal language:
          - Model is pre-trained on stories with non-formal language - it should be compatible
          - While dataset includes real world facts, they should be served in story-like format
        3. Referential Integrity:
          - Each follow-up references 3+ facts from previous answers
          - Final answer must combine facts from {prior_steps} previous steps
        4. Progressive Retention:
          - Each answer is on the same topic
          - Knowledge is accumulated in answers
          - Queries reference previous answers
        5. Do not repeat examples
          - each item should be unique - do not use the same examples as provided
          - please do not generate same examples as in FEW SHOTS items should be new
          - don't generate examples in same topics as in FEW SHOT EXAMPLES, like Mount Everest, Nile description, Amazon forest, Grand Canyon, Coral Reef, Sequoia Trees or Great Wall
          - be creative for topics
          - try a lot different topics
